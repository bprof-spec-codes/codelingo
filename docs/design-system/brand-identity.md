## Core Values and Personality
----
+ **Modern education**: as an educational platform, we have to make learning *easy* and *accessible* for everyone
+ **Professional but playful**: we must show *professionalism* towards the users, but in a way that is *entertaining* and *playful*
+ **Motivating**: we have to *inspire* the users to practice a lot and improve their level
+ **Reliability**: everything we offer to the users, especially the practice tasks, must be  *precise* and *clear*.

## Design Philosophy & Principles 
--- 
We use **Desktop first** design approach because similar applications where you have to write codes are always complicated from a smartphone, but a responsive interface is expected from us.

We need to create a *simple, clean interface* where users can easily navigate where they want. To achieve this we have to:
+ use **few colors**, but they should be eye-catching
+ use a **consistent system** in every component
+ use **easily readable typography**, especially in code presentation
